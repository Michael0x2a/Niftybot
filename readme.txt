# Niftybot #

## Introduction ##

A StudentRND Labs project


## Running the program ##

Have the following libraries installed:

-   SimpleCV:  
    http://www.simplecv.org/
-   Python Arduino Command API:  
    https://github.com/thearn/Python-Arduino-Command-API
    
Then run:

    python niftybot.py
    

You may need to modify your PATH or PYTHONPATH environmental variables to 
include the following path if Python complains about not being able to 
load the `cv` module.

    C:\SimpleCV1.3\files\opencv\build\python\2.7

In addition, if you keep getting mysterious errors related to the camera, 
try manually reinstalling the latest version of the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)
module, and perhaps the `Pillow` module (a reboot of PIL).
    
## Reading the code ##

The code is structured roughly like a book. After installing all the 
prerequisite libraries, start from `code/nitybot.py`.
